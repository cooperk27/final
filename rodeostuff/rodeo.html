                        <li>Bull Riding</li>
                            <ul>The objective of this event is to mount and ride the bull for 8 seconds.</ul>
                            <ul>It is known as the most dangerous eight seconds on sports and rightfully so.</ul>
                        <li>Rough Stock Scoring</li>
                            <ul>Scoring for rough stock events is out of 100 points. 50 for the rider and 50 for the animal.</ul>
                            <ul>The harder the animal bucks, the higher the score. And the more in control the rider is, the higher their score.</ul>
                        <li>Here is a video of one of the highest scored ride to date. Jose Vitor Leme rides Whoopa for a score of 98.75.</li>

                        <li>Saddle Bronc</li>
                            <ul>Considered rodeo’s “classic event”, the cowboy rides in a saddle with his feet in the stirrups
                                and holds on with just one hand to a perfectly measured “bronc rein”,
                                which is a thick strap connected to a halter on the horse’s head.</ul>
                            <ul>Pictured above far left is an example.</ul>
                            <li>Bareback Bronc</li>
                            <ul>The Bareback event is similar to the saddle bronc event, however instead of a saddle, riders use a 'riggin' to hold onto the horse.</ul>
                            <ul>The riggin is a small handle mounted high on the horses back made out of leather and rawhide. It is a small handle that rider use to grab hold of to ride the bucking horse.</ul>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Broncs</li>
                            <ul>These events are scored the same as all rough stock events, but the mark-out and freehand rules apply.</ul>

        <h2>Roping Events</h2>
        
            <h4>Team Roping</h4>
            
                <li>Team Roping </li>
                    <ul>This event consist of a team of cowboys a 'header' and a 'healer'.</ul>
                    <ul>The headers job is to rope the steers horns or horn and neck, the healers goal is to rope the hind legs.</ul>
                    <ul>Any other catch is illegal and if the healer manages to rope only 1 leg there is a 5 second penalty. Once the cowboys make legal catches and face up their horses to each other, the clock stops.
                        This event requires great skill and accuracy.</ul>
            
            <h4>Tie-Down Roping</h4>
            
                <li>Tie-Down Roping </li>
                    <ul>This event is my favorite to watch. It takes skill, speed, strength, agility, and lots of practice.</ul>
                    <ul>The calf is released from the chute and after it reaches the head start point coyboy must catch up, ropes the calf's neck which is tied to his saddle.
                        Once caught the rider dismounts and runs over to the calf, flanks him by grabbing and flippin them onto their side and tie up three of the calf's feet.
                        They use a piggin string to tie up the legs and once the the cowboy raises his hands the time stops.</ul>
                    <ul>However the calf must stayed tied up on the ground for 6 seconds once the rider remounts and gives some slack on the rope in order for the time to be qualify.</ul>
                        
                        <ul>Pictured above middle is an example.</ul>
            
            <h4>Breakaway Roping</h4>
            
                <li>Breakaway Roping Overview</li>
                    <ul>This is a newer event which is growing fast with the women in rodeo.</ul>
                    <ul>This event is very similar to tie-down roping however, the riders do not dismount and  tie up the calf.</ul> 
                    <ul> Rather the rider chases the calf out of the chute once they reach teh head start point then they catch up and rope the calf around the neck.
                        The rider then stops their horse and as the rope tightens the nylon string attatched to the saddle breaks with the tension and the calf is released. 
                        Hence the name breakaway. The timer stops when the rope breaks away and there is often a cloth attatched to the rope to make it more visible. And of course the fastest time wins.</ul>
            </ul>

        <h2>Timed Events</h2>
        These two events are outliers, thus I deemed them as timed events.<br>
        <h4>Barrel Racing</h4>
            <li>Barrel Racing </li>
                <ul>Riders are tasked with completing the full pattern whitout kncoking any barrels down (if they do, it is a 5 second penalty).</ul>
                <ul>The pattern is known as a clover leaf pattern, the barrels are arranged in a traingle with two in line closest to the start line.</ul>
                <ul>The rider has to complete the clover pattern making a full circle around each barrel and the fastest time wins.</ul>
                <ul>This is generally known as a ladies event, yet it requires speed precision and incredible balance.</ul>
                    <ul>Pictured above far right is an example.</ul>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steer Wrestling</h4>
            <li>Steer Wrestling</li>
                <ul>This event is one of the most fun to watch. It requires athleticism and strength.</ul>
                <ul>It starts with a rider and horse backed into the box and a steer in the shute. There is another rider and horse in the other box to help keep the steer running in a straight line. </ul>
                <ul>At the riders command the steer races out of the chute. They must wait for the steer to reach the head start point of the after being released or they are disqualified. 
                    The rider must catch up to the steer, dismount their horse, slow the steer, and wrestle the steer down to lay him flat on the ground with all four legs facing the same direction.</ul>
